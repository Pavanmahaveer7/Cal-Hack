# VAPI Configuration
VAPI_API_KEY=vapi_your_actual_api_key_here
VAPI_BASE_URL=https://api.vapi.ai
VAPI_ASSISTANT_ID=your_assistant_id_here
VAPI_PHONE_NUMBER_ID=your_phone_number_id_here
```

### 2.2 Create Assistant in VAPI Dashboard
1. Go to VAPI Dashboard â†’ Assistants
2. Click "Create Assistant"
3. Configure the assistant:
   - **Name**: "Braillience AI Teacher"
   - **Model**: GPT-4 or Claude
   - **Voice**: Choose a natural voice
   - **Language**: English (US)
   - **System Message**: (See Step 3.1)

## Step 3: Assistant Configuration

### 3.1 System Message Template
```
You are an AI teacher for Braillience, an accessible learning platform for blind college students. Your role is to:

1. TEACHING APPROACH:
   - Act as a patient, encouraging teacher
   - Explain concepts clearly and thoroughly
   - Use analogies and examples to help understanding
   - Ask questions to check comprehension
   - Provide positive reinforcement

2. DOCUMENT CONTENT:
   Document: "{document_name}"
   Content: {document_content}
   
3. KEY CONCEPTS TO COVER:
{flashcard_summary}

4. TEACHING METHODOLOGY:
   - Start with an overview of the document
   - Walk through key concepts one by one
   - Ask the student to explain concepts back to you
   - Provide hints if they're struggling
   - Use the flashcards as discussion points
   - Encourage questions and discussion

5. INTERACTION STYLE:
   - Be conversational and friendly
   - Speak clearly and at a good pace
   - Use phrases like "Let's explore this together"
   - Ask "Does that make sense?" frequently
   - Provide encouragement and praise

6. ADAPTIVE TEACHING:
   - If the student seems confused, slow down and re-explain
   - If they understand quickly, move to more advanced concepts
   - Always check for understanding before moving on
   - Be patient with questions and clarifications

Remember: You're teaching a blind student, so focus on auditory learning and clear explanations. Make the learning experience engaging and accessible.
```

### 3.2 First Message Template
```
Hello! I'm your AI teacher for Braillience. I'm going to walk through your document "{document_name}" with you. This document has {flashcard_count} key concepts we'll explore together. Are you ready to begin learning?
```

## Step 4: Backend Integration

### 4.1 Update VAPI Service
The VAPI service is already configured to use real VAPI calls when credentials are provided.

### 4.2 Test VAPI Connection
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/voice-learning/test-vapi \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userId": "test-user"}'
```

## Step 5: Frontend Integration

### 5.1 VAPITeacher Component
The VAPITeacher component is already set up to:
- Collect user phone number
- Select document to study
- Start real VAPI calls
- Show call status

### 5.2 Testing the Integration
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Login with demo credentials
3. Click "AI Teacher Call"
4. Enter your real phone number
5. Select a document
6. Click "Start Teacher Call"

## Step 6: Real VAPI Call Flow

### 6.1 Call Initiation
1. User enters phone number and selects document
2. Frontend sends request to `/api/voice-learning/start-teacher-call`
3. Backend creates VAPI call with:
   - User's phone number
   - Document content
   - Generated flashcards
   - Teacher assistant configuration

### 6.2 VAPI Call Process
1. VAPI calls the user's phone
2. AI teacher greets the student
3. Teacher walks through document content
4. Interactive Q&A session
5. Progress tracking and feedback
6. Call ends when complete

### 6.3 Call Management
- **Duration**: Up to 1 hour per session
- **Cost**: VAPI charges per minute
- **Quality**: High-quality voice synthesis
- **Recording**: Optional call recording for review

## Step 7: Production Considerations

### 7.1 Cost Management
- VAPI charges per minute of call time
- Monitor usage and set limits
- Consider session duration limits

### 7.2 Error Handling
- Handle failed calls gracefully
- Provide fallback options
- Log call attempts and results

### 7.3 Security
- Validate phone numbers
- Rate limit call attempts
- Secure API key storage

## Step 8: Testing Checklist

### 8.1 Pre-Production Testing
- [ ] VAPI account configured
- [ ] Phone number purchased
- [ ] Assistant created and tested
- [ ] API keys working
- [ ] Test call successful

### 8.2 Production Testing
- [ ] Real phone call received
- [ ] AI teacher responds correctly
- [ ] Document content discussed
- [ ] Call quality acceptable
- [ ] Session ends properly

## Step 9: Monitoring and Analytics

### 9.1 VAPI Dashboard
- Monitor call logs
- Track success rates
- Analyze conversation quality
- Review user feedback

### 9.2 Custom Analytics
- Track learning progress
- Monitor session duration
- Analyze document effectiveness
- Measure student engagement

## Step 10: Troubleshooting

### 10.1 Common Issues
