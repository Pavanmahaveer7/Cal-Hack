# Letta Integration Guide for Braillience

## 🧠 **Stateful VAPI Agent with Letta Cloud Integration**

This guide shows you how to integrate **Letta Cloud** with your Braillience app for powerful stateful conversation management using VAPI transcripts.

## 🚀 **What You Get:**

- **🧠 Stateful Agents**: Letta creates personalized AI agents that remember every conversation
- **📝 VAPI Transcript Processing**: Automatically processes and stores VAPI call transcripts
- **🔄 Conversation Memory**: Agents remember learning patterns, preferences, and progress
- **🎯 Personalized Responses**: Each student gets a unique, adaptive learning experience
- **📊 Learning Analytics**: Deep insights into student learning patterns and progress

## 📋 **Prerequisites:**

1. **Letta Cloud Account**: Sign up at [letta.com](https://letta.com)
2. **VAPI Account**: Already configured for voice calls
3. **API Keys**: Letta API key and VAPI credentials

## 🔧 **Setup Instructions:**

### **Step 1: Get Letta API Key**

1. Go to [Letta Cloud Dashboard](https://cloud.letta.com)
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Navigate to **API Keys** section
4. Generate a new API key
5. Copy the API key (starts with `letta_`)

### **Step 2: Configure Environment Variables**

Add to your `backend/.env` file:

```bash
# Letta Integration
LETTA_API_KEY=letta_your_actual_api_key_here
LETTA_BASE_URL=https://api.letta.com/v1
```

### **Step 3: Test Letta Integration**

```bash
# Test Letta connection
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/vapi-transcripts/create-agent \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userId": "demo-user", "userContext": {"preferredLearningStyle": "auditory"}}'
```

## 🎯 **How It Works:**

### **1. VAPI Call Flow:**
```
Student calls → VAPI processes → Transcript generated → Letta stores → Stateful agent learns
```

### **2. Stateful Learning:**
```
First Call: "Hello! Welcome to your learning journey..."
Second Call: "Welcome back! I see you were studying biology yesterday. Let's continue..."
Third Call: "Great progress! You've mastered 5 concepts. Let's build on that..."
```

### **3. Letta Agent Features:**
- **Memory Blocks**: Stores user profile, learning context, conversation history
- **Adaptive Teaching**: Adjusts to learning style and pace
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitors mastery level and improvement
- **Personalized Greetings**: Context-aware opening messages

## 📡 **API Endpoints:**

### **Process VAPI Transcript:**
```bash
POST /api/vapi-transcripts/process-transcript
{
  "userId": "demo-user",
  "callId": "vapi-call-123",
  "transcript": "User: Hello\nAssistant: Hi! Let's start learning...",
  "metadata": {
    "phoneNumber": "+16506844796",
    "documentId": "4",
    "documentName": "Biology Chapter 1",
    "mode": "teacher"
  }
}
```

### **Get Stateful Response:**
```bash
POST /api/vapi-transcripts/stateful-response
{
  "userId": "demo-user",
  "userInput": "I want to learn about cells",
  "context": {
    "currentDocument": "Biology Chapter 1",
    "learningMode": "teacher"
  }
}
```

### **Get Conversation History:**
```bash
GET /api/vapi-transcripts/history/demo-user
```

### **Create Letta Agent:**
```bash
POST /api/vapi-transcripts/create-agent
{
  "userId": "demo-user",
  "userContext": {
    "preferredLearningStyle": "auditory",
    "masteryLevel": "beginner",
    "strengths": ["positive_feedback"],
    "weaknesses": ["needs_repetition"]
  }
}
```

## 🧠 **Letta Agent Configuration:**

Each student gets a personalized Letta agent with:

### **Memory Blocks:**
- **user_profile**: Learning style, mastery level, preferences
- **learning_context**: Braillience-specific teaching approach
- **conversation_history**: All previous learning interactions

### **System Prompt:**
```
You are a personalized AI tutor for Braillience, an accessible learning platform for blind college students.

Your role is to:
1. Provide patient, encouraging teaching
2. Adapt to the student's learning style and pace
3. Remember previous conversations and build on them
4. Use clear, descriptive language suitable for auditory learning
5. Provide personalized greetings based on learning history
6. Track learning progress and adapt teaching strategies
```

## 📊 **Learning Analytics:**

Letta provides deep insights into:

- **Learning Patterns**: Preferred learning style, pace, difficulty
- **Progress Tracking**: Mastery level, improvement trends
- **Conversation Quality**: Engagement, comprehension, retention
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Study strategies, focus areas

## 🔄 **Integration Flow:**

### **1. First Student Call:**
```javascript
// VAPI call happens
// Transcript is generated
// Letta agent is created
// Transcript is stored in Letta
// Agent learns student's patterns
```

### **2. Subsequent Calls:**
```javascript
// VAPI call happens
// Transcript is generated
// Letta agent retrieves conversation history
// Agent provides personalized, context-aware responses
// New transcript is stored for future learning
```

## 🎯 **Example Stateful Conversation:**

### **First Call:**
```
Agent: "Hello! Welcome to your personalized learning experience. I'm here to help you succeed!"
Student: "I want to learn about biology"
Agent: "Great! Let's start with the basics. What do you already know about cells?"
```

### **Second Call (Next Day):**
```
Agent: "Welcome back! I see you were studying biology yesterday. You mentioned knowing about cell structure. Let's build on that knowledge!"
Student: "I want to learn more about DNA"
Agent: "Perfect! Since you understand cell structure, DNA will make more sense. Let's explore how DNA is organized within cells..."
```

### **Third Call (Week Later):**
```
Agent: "Excellent! You've been making great progress with biology. You've mastered cell structure and DNA basics. Ready for the next challenge?"
Student: "Yes, I want to learn about genetics"
Agent: "Wonderful! Your strong foundation in DNA will help you understand genetics. Let's start with how traits are inherited..."
```
