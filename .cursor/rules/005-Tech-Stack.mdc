# Technology Stack Guidelines

## Overview
This rule defines the technology stack decisions for the Cal-Hack project (Duolingo for Blind Users). Reference this rule when implementing features to ensure consistency with chosen technologies.

## Frontend Technology
**Status:** TO BE DECIDED
- React (recommended for accessibility)
- Vue.js (alternative)
- Vanilla JavaScript (lightweight option)

## Backend Technology  
**Status:** TO BE DECIDED
- Node.js/Express (recommended for JavaScript ecosystem)
- Python/FastAPI (alternative)
- PHP/Laravel (alternative)

## Database
**Status:** TO BE DECIDED
- PostgreSQL (recommended for relational data)
- MongoDB (alternative for document storage)
- SQLite (development/testing)

## Accessibility Libraries
**Status:** TO BE DECIDED
- React Aria (if using React)
- ARIA libraries
- Screen reader testing tools

## Audio Processing
**Status:** TO BE DECIDED
- Web Audio API (native)
- Howler.js (audio library)
- Speech Synthesis API

## Testing Framework
**Status:** TO BE DECIDED
- Jest (JavaScript testing)
- Cypress (E2E testing)
- Accessibility testing tools

## Deployment
**Status:** TO BE DECIDED
- Vercel/Netlify (frontend)
- Railway/Heroku (backend)
- AWS (full stack)

## Usage Instructions
1. Reference this rule when making technology decisions: `@.cursor/rules/005-Tech-Stack.mdc`
2. Update this file as decisions are made
3. Ensure all chosen technologies support accessibility requirements
4. Consider performance implications for audio-heavy features

## Accessibility Requirements
- All technologies must support screen readers
- Keyboard navigation compatibility
- Audio processing capabilities
- Mobile accessibility support
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

## Next Steps
1. Use PRD generation to define requirements for each technology choice
2. Create proof-of-concept implementations
3. Test accessibility with actual screen readers
4. Update this file with final decisions
