          <p>
            Braillience is dedicated to breaking down barriers in education by providing 
            accessible learning tools specifically designed for blind and visually impaired 
            college students. We believe that everyone deserves equal access to quality 
            education, regardless of their abilities.

          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            Braillience was born from a simple observation: traditional study tools like 
            Quizlet, while powerful, often fall short when it comes to accessibility. 
            As college students ourselves, we witnessed friends and classmates struggle 
            with inaccessible learning platforms.
          </p>
          <p>
            We decided to change that. Our team of developers, designers, and accessibility 
            experts came together to create a platform that doesn't just accommodate 
            different abilitiesâ€”it celebrates them.
