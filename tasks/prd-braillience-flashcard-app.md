# Product Requirements Document: Braillience Flashcard App

## Introduction/Overview

Braillience is a web-based flashcard application designed specifically for blind college students. The app addresses the critical gap in accessible learning tools for adult braille learners who don't receive Teacher of the Visually Impaired (TVI) support. By combining PDF processing, AI-powered flashcard generation, and voice-first interaction through VAPI and Gemini, Braillience provides an inclusive learning experience that adapts to the unique needs of blind students.

**Goal**: Create an accessible, voice-driven flashcard application that enables blind college students to independently study course materials through AI-generated flashcards and voice interaction.

## Goals

1. **Accessibility First**: Provide a fully accessible learning experience for blind users through voice commands and screen reader compatibility
2. **Independent Learning**: Enable blind students to study course materials without requiring sighted assistance
3. **AI-Powered Content**: Automatically generate meaningful flashcards from PDF documents using AI
4. **Voice-First Interaction**: Create seamless voice-driven user experience through VAPI and Gemini integration
5. **Progress Tracking**: Help students monitor their learning progress and retention

## User Stories

1. **As a blind college student**, I want to upload my course PDFs so that I can create study materials without sighted assistance
2. **As a blind college student**, I want the system to automatically generate flashcards from my PDFs so that I don't have to manually create study materials
3. **As a blind college student**, I want to learn through voice interaction so that I can study hands-free and efficiently
4. **As a blind college student**, I want to take tests with voice commands so that I can assess my knowledge independently
5. **As a blind college student**, I want the system to track my progress so that I can see my improvement over time
6. **As a blind college student**, I want the system to help me when I'm stuck so that I can continue learning without frustration
